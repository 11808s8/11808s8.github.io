Currently a Cloud Operations Engineer at Mission Cloud, focusing on AWS related services and tasks ranging from DevOps to Linux/Windows admin tasks (and automating them with Python and/or *other tools/languages*), with a plethora of different loads inbetween.  

I'm also a web developer, from my previous life and spare time, having worked with PHP, JS (Node and TS), Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL and so on.  

Pretty sure most of it is covered in my [Linkedin Profile](https://linkedin.com/in/adrianogs), so lets use that for the sake of DRY, right? Right on!  

This page is currently a big draft so only time will tell what'll be around here.  

Have a nice one!
