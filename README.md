# Personal Website

Project of my [personal website](11808s8.github.io) leveraging [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a custom version of [theme KeepIt](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt). To view the old version of the website (and its templating system leveraging gulp + pure html/css/js, go to the [old_version folder](old_version/).  
Using github pages to deploy! :D

## Development 
### Requirements
* Hugo

### Workflow to have it running locally
Access the **src** folder and run `$ ./hugome` to have a working version of the website locally and also generate its files to the root directory (where github pages will run the static files). The config.toml might need to be changed to reflect the local root dir ( which is "/").  
For more on the development itself, check the documentation of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the theme in use.
